# face-mask-detection
This face mask detection system automates the real-time detection and classification of individuals as masked or unmasked, reducing the need for human oversight while maintaining high accuracy. Its scalable design makes it suitable for various environments, including workplaces, schools, healthcare facilities, and public spaces.
Using computer vision and deep learning, the system can automatically detect if someone is wearing a mask or not. It reduces the need for manual checks, avoids mistakes, and ensures consistent monitoring. This helps improve safety and lowers the risks of spreading diseases.
